> Slice strings while preserving ansi characters

[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@arcanis/slice-ansi.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@arcanis/slice-ansi.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/developed%20with-Yarn%202-blue)](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Installation

```
yarn add @arcanis/slice-ansi
```

## Why

Unlike the [Chalk version](https://github.com/chalk/slice-ansi), this completely different implementation:

- Supports terminal hyperlinks
- Leverages the native grapheme splitting API if available
- Doesn't require ESM, because it's an inane requirement for a library like this

## Caveat

This implementation also doesn't attempt to interpret the escape codes to optimize them away. So for instance, if you start with the following but only want to keep the first 16 characters:

```
${openBold}This is the header with ${openRed}ansi words${closeRed}${closeBold}
```

The end result will be:

```
${openBold}This is the head${openRed}${closeRed}${closeBold}
```

As you can see, the `${openRed}${closeRed}` didn't get removed, even if they are now empty. This is because this package doesn't know that `openRed` (`\u001b[31m`) is "closed" by `closeRed` (`\u001b[39m`). Keeping these information would make the package more complex for a benefit deemed fairly limited, since nothing will be printed anyway.
